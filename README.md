# Overview of Earthquake Mapping Project
This project uses `tectonic plate and major earthquake` LineString data, `html` and `geoJSON() layers` customization  to identify earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth to show all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5



---
## Results
    
    
   * `JavaScript`, `Leaflet.js`, and `geoJSON` data was used to add tectonic plate data to stand out on the map
    
#### Tectonic Plate Data

   * `JavaScript`, `Leaflet.js`, and `geoJSON`  data was used to major earthquake data to the map and customization using colors, popup marker  and  circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake

#### Major Earthquake Data

   * `JavaScript`, `Leaflet.js`, and `geoJSON`  data was used to add a third map style to your earthquake map
